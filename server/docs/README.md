## Key Concepts Summary

### Commission Rates
- **E-Games**: 30% of GGR (Gross Gaming Revenue)
- **Sports Betting**: 2% of bet amount (minus refunds)
- **Speciality Games RNG**: 30% of GGR
- **Speciality Games Tote**: 2% of bet amount

### User Hierarchy
```
Super Admin ‚Üí Operator ‚Üí Platinum ‚Üí Golden
```

### Settlement Flow
- Golden agents settled by Platinum
- Platinum agents settled by Operators  
- Operators settled by Super Admin

### Core Calculations
- **Revenue**: `Bet Amount - Payout Amount`
- **Commission**: `Base Amount √ó Commission Rate`
- **Net Payout**: `Total Commission - User Share - Parent Share - Fees`

## Common Use Cases

### Calculating Commission for a Transaction
1. Determine platform type (E-Games, Sports Betting, etc.)
2. Calculate base amount based on platform rules
3. Apply appropriate commission rate
4. Factor in user role and hierarchy
5. Deduct payment gateway fees

### Generating Daily Commission Summaries
1. Fetch all transactions for the date
2. Group by user ID and platform category
3. Apply role-specific commission calculations
4. Create commission summary records
5. Set settlement status to pending

### Processing User Payouts
1. Validate settlement status by role hierarchy
2. Calculate total commission amounts by platform
3. Subtract user's commission share
4. Subtract parent commission (if applicable)
5. Subtract payment gateway fees
6. Return final payout amount

## Update Guidelines

When modifying commission calculations:

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all three documentation files reflect changes
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Commission calculations affect financial transactions
3. **Version Control**: Tag releases that change calculation logic
4. **Audit Trail**: Log all commission calculation changes
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Consider impact on historical data
